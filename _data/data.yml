    title: About me
    summary: |
        Mankind is capable of and has achieved nothing short of miracles. But like it or 
        not we are plagued with problems, ranging from religion and politics to energy 
        and resources. It is true that you and I exist at the pinnacle of civilization, 
        a time where flight and instantaneous communication is commonplace. However, our
        problems too have advanced to extraordinary scales. In such a short life, one can 
        barely make a scratch in the face of our tremendous obstacles. Call me naive, as 
        others have, but I wish to make more than a scratch; I wish to achieve the magnitudes 
        of progress that came from the minds of Galileo, Newton, Tesla, and others. I dream 
        of a world not perfect but very well damn near.
